# Tower-Defence-game
My first game created in c++ using SFML library. Although i'm proud of this project some things could be changed. These are: add multithreading to solve the performance problem, add more levels and kinds of enemy/ally entities, solve clock problem (irregular operations). 
Overall project was working and I was able to play this game.
