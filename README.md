# Tower-Defence-game
This is my first project using SFML library and OOP style. I made a tower defense type game, where player with given amount of money need to buy defense objects to protect the end of a map. Enemies will come from one place and follow a path till the end. Player gets money for every survived round as a reward. You have to be careful and watch for your health bar... 

Although i'm proud of this project some things could be changed. These are: add multithreading to solve the performance problem, add more levels and kinds of enemy/ally entities, solve clock problem (irregular operations). 

Overall project was working and I was able to play this game.
