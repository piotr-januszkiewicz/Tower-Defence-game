This is my first project using sfml library and OOP style. I made a tower defense type game, where player with given amount of money need to buy defense objects to protect the end of a map. Enemies will come from one place and follow a path till the end. If player survives the round he (or she) gets money as a reward. You have to be careful and watch for your health bar...
